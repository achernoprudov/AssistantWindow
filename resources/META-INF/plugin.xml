  <description>
    Plugin allow you to open files like XCode.
    Sometimes its very useful to open different files in one window with splitter.
    With this plugin your could easily do this!
    Plugin add to context menu two actions:
    Open in Main Window - opens file in main(first group) window.
    Open in Assistant Window - opens file in assistant(second group) window. File Editor will splitted if it is not.
    You could use this function in Assistant Search Everywhere too!
    Assistant Search Everywhere is very similar(copied) to Search Everywhere. The only difference is that Assistant
    Search Everywhere could be opened in Main Window(if you just hit Enter or click on element) or in Assistant
    Window and slit window if it is necessary.
